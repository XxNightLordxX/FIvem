## [Unreleased]

Phase 2 (tracking, contraband search, vision, door interaction) has landed
on this branch as a complete feature set with real client and server
implementations, but it has **not** been through the same release-readiness
pass Phase 1 got before shipping — there is no version bump yet. Since Phase
2 landed, this branch has also picked up scent tracking's previously-missing
server-side source resolution, a resource-wide cooldown/mutex refactor, a
`luacheck` CI job, the certification-revocation TOCTOU fix below, three
native-correctness corrections, door interaction's previously-deferred
nudge-open half, and the first (still feature-flagged-off) slice of Phase
4's vitality HUD. Phase 3
(combat/action features) still has **no implementation** — `PHASE3_SPEC.md`
has been revised (Revision 3: player-vs-player K9 combat is now a settled,
in-scope design decision, reversing an earlier NPC-only default), but that
is a design-document change only, not code. Everything below is pending
final packaging.

### Added

- **Scent/blood/gunpowder tracking** — a certified handler can start a
  self-following trail for any of the three configured scent types from a
  new "K9 Unit" radial submenu entry per type (Track Scent / Track Blood /
  Track Gunpowder), each an independent start/cancel toggle gated by its
  own `Config.Features` flag. Trails render as ground markers with
  configurable spacing and decay across water crossings, cutting off
  cleanly at the water's edge rather than vanishing outright.
- **Scent trail source resolution (`server/tracking.lua`)** — closes the
  gap the previous entry in this file flagged as an explicit, disclosed
  "can never functionally succeed" blocker. A real, first-party
  `ox_inventory` server-side hook,
  `exports.ox_inventory:registerHook('swapItems', ...)`, now feeds a
  ground-drop's coordinates into the same `TrackableLog`/nearest-source
  lookup blood and gunpowder already used, so "Track Scent" can now
  actually resolve to a real dropped-item location instead of always
  reporting "not found." The hook fires server-to-server (never a
  client-triggerable event), so unlike blood/gunpowder's relay events it
  has no "forged trail" acceptable-risk framing to write — the reported
  source can't be spoofed by a modified client the way a fabricated damage
  or weapon-fire report could be.
- **Contraband search** — a certified handler can search a nearby vehicle
  or person via ox_target ("Search Vehicle" / "Search Person"), with the
  server performing the real, container-recursive inventory read and
  returning a found/clean/failed result. Searches are rate-limited on two
  independent cooldowns, and any bystander-facing contraband alert is
  distance-filtered to nearby players in the search zone rather than
  broadcast server-wide.
- **Search audit log** — every completed search attempt (found, clean, or
  failed) is now written to a new `k9_search_log` table for dispute
  accountability. Early rejections (too far, on cooldown, etc.) are never
  logged, since they never actually touch the target.
- **Thermal and night vision** — togglable vision modes for any player while
  playing a configured K9 character. Deliberately gated on the K9 model
  alone, not certification — treated as innate perception, not a granted
  departmental privilege.
- **Door interaction (scratch-to-alert + nudge-open)** — a certified
  handler can scratch at a nearby door-like object via ox_target to
  broadcast an alert sound to everyone with that door streamed in
  (server-authoritative: `server/main.lua` independently resolves,
  existence-checks, and proximity-checks the claimed door before ever
  broadcasting, never trusting the client's own door guess). A second,
  separate "Nudge Door" ox_target option on the same objects has now
  landed too, previously deferred as out of scope for Phase 2's first
  drop. Its safety design is deliberate and non-negotiable: it never calls
  any door-lock/CDoor native and never reads, writes, freezes, or moves
  the door entity in any way — the only real-world safe design available,
  since most door-lock resources manage their own lock flag entirely
  outside GTA's native door system, so treating "not registered there" as
  "unlocked" would be a real bypass, not a theoretical one. The feature's
  only actual effect is a cosmetic push impulse and sound applied to the
  K9's own ped (never the door), gated purely by interaction distance and
  `CanShowK9UI()`. It has **zero server involvement** — no
  `TriggerServerEvent`, no callback, nothing server-authoritative touched
  anywhere in the implementation.
- **Full Phase 2 config schema** — `Config.Tracking`, `Config.SearchZones`,
  `Config.SearchContrabandItems`, `Config.DoorInteraction`,
  `Config.Vision`, and related tuning tables, plus a `Config.Features`
  flag per Phase 2 feature so each can be enabled independently once ready.
  New `ox_inventory` dependency (required by contraband search).
- **Resource-start config safety check** — the resource now refuses to
  start if `Config.DoorInteraction.nudgeRequiresUnlocked` has been set to
  `false`. It's documented as a hard safety requirement (nudge-open must
  never be able to bypass a locked door), not a server-tunable option, so
  a bad value now fails loudly at startup instead of silently allowing a
  future lockpick-equivalent bypass. Now that nudge-open has actually
  landed (see the Added entry above), this assertion — not a runtime
  branch inside the feature itself — is the full extent of how this field
  is enforced: nudge-open has no real lock-state read anywhere for it to
  meaningfully gate, by design, so a future implementer would have to
  deliberately remove this assertion before wiring a real (dangerous)
  lock-state branch off it.
- **Shared cooldown/TTL/mutex helper (`server/cooldowns.lua`)** — a pure
  structural extraction, not a redesign. The 11 independent hand-rolled
  cooldown/mutex tables that had accumulated across `server/main.lua`,
  `server/certifications.lua`, `server/tracking.lua`, and `server/search.lua`
  now build on three shared constructors: `NewCooldown` (flat
  `key -> lastTouchedAt`, covers 9 of the 11 — bark, leash-request,
  door-scratch, certify-action, damage/weapon-fire relay, and search
  cooldowns), `NewNestedCooldown` (the two-level per-source/per-track-type
  shape `server/tracking.lua`'s scent/blood/gunpowder query cooldown
  needs), and `NewMutex` (the plain acquire/release lock
  `server/search.lua`'s in-flight guard needs). Every migrated call site
  keeps its exact original threshold, key shape, and cleanup timing
  (`playerDropped` handler or periodic sweep, matching whichever the
  original table used) — behavior is unchanged, only the duplicated
  bookkeeping code across four files is not. Loaded first among this
  resource's own `server_scripts`, since the other four files call these
  constructors at their own file-load time.
- **Added `luacheck` to CI**, alongside the existing `luac5.4 -p` syntax
  check (`.github/workflows/lua-check.yml`), configured via a new
  repo-root `.luacheckrc` with a curated `read_globals` list of the real
  FiveM/CFX natives this resource actually calls and a `globals` list of
  its own cross-file globals (`Config`, `NewCooldown`/`NewNestedCooldown`/
  `NewMutex`, `HasK9Access`, etc.) so real, intentional patterns aren't
  flagged as undefined/unused. `unused_args` and `max_line_length` are
  deliberately left off, with the reasoning documented inline in
  `.luacheckrc` itself. The one real finding it surfaced — an "empty if
  branch" warning (542) on `client/search.lua`'s deliberately-silent
  `on_cooldown`/`search_in_progress` UX branch — turned out to be a false
  positive, not a bug, and is suppressed with an inline
  `-- luacheck: ignore 542` comment rather than "fixed" by changing
  behavior.
- **Phase 4 vitality HUD (`client/hud.lua`, still off by default)** — this
  resource's first NUI surface: a passive, always-visible-while-relevant
  overlay showing health/stamina/hunger/thirst for the active K9
  character, gated by the new `Config.Features.HealthStaminaHUD` flag
  (ships `false`). Visibility uses the same `CanShowK9UI()` gate (K9 model
  **and** live server-side access check) the radial menu already uses —
  this HUD is treated as a department-issued monitoring instrument, not
  the K9's innate perception, so unlike thermal/night vision it does
  **not** display for an uncertified player just because they're
  K9-modeled. Pushes to the NUI are change-threshold- and
  heartbeat-driven rather than a fixed poll broadcast, to avoid spamming
  `SendNUIMessage`, and the overlay never calls `SetNuiFocus` — it has no
  interactive element to focus, by design. Wired into `fxmanifest.lua`
  (`ui_page`, `html/index.html`/`style.css`/`app.js`) but genuinely inert
  end-to-end while the flag stays `false`.

### Security

These were found and fixed during Phase 2's own review passes before this
work was considered done, in the same spirit as Phase 1's four post-review
fixes:

- **Fixed a stale-entity-handle reuse in contraband search.** The client
  used to hold a raw entity handle across the full sniff-animation delay
  before resolving it to a network id — if the original target
  disconnected or was streamed out mid-animation, the recycled handle
  could end up resolving to the wrong player or vehicle. The network id is
  now captured immediately, before the animation starts.
- **Fixed trails vanishing outright at a water crossing instead of
  rendering up to the water's edge.** A redundant same-tick check in the
  trail-drawing loop set the "broken by water" flag before that same
  tick's draw pass ran, erasing the entire already-walked trail instantly
  rather than stopping cleanly at the crossing point as intended.
- **Added the missing radial menu entry point for tracking.** The
  scent/blood/gunpowder tracking functions had no in-game way to trigger
  or cancel a trail at all — nothing called them. Three context-sensitive
  radial items (start/cancel toggle per type) were added, each gated by
  its own feature flag. A follow-up bug in that same wiring was then found
  and fixed: switching to a different track type while already tracking
  silently canceled the active trail instead of switching to the new one,
  requiring a second click to actually start it. Clicking a different
  track type now correctly falls through to the proper "already tracking —
  stop first" notice instead of silently killing the wrong trail.
- **Fixed a watchdog-killing unclamped loop.** The trail marker-spacing
  draw loop advanced by a config-driven step with no lower-bound clamp; a
  misconfigured spacing value of zero or negative would have spun it
  forever with no yield. Not triggerable with the shipped default values,
  but now clamped to match an existing sibling loop's precedent.
- **Closed a door-scratch abuse vector (sustained broadcast spam).** A
  per-player cooldown alone didn't stop multiple separate certified
  accounts from independently hammering the *same* door, sustaining
  roughly 1,200 broadcasts/hour indefinitely with no cap. A second,
  door-keyed cooldown now has to pass alongside the per-player one before
  a scratch alert broadcasts, with its own periodic cleanup sweep since a
  door has no disconnect event to key cleanup off of.
- **Closed an entity-type spoofing gap in the same door-scratch handler.**
  A player standing near a real bystander could previously supply that
  bystander's own player or vehicle network id instead of a door's,
  triggering a server-wide alert anchored to the victim. The server now
  rejects anything that isn't actually an object before broadcasting,
  never trusting the client's own "is this door-shaped" check as the real
  gate.
- **Excluded a vehicle-tucked K9 from the door-scratch interaction.** A K9
  loaded into a K9 vehicle could still be offered the "Scratch to Alert"
  option, which made no sense in that state. Mirrors the existing
  vehicle-tuck exclusion already applied to the leash pull-back logic.
- **Closed a certification-revocation TOCTOU gap in contraband search.**
  `HasK9Access` was only checked once, at the moment a search request came
  in — but `server/search.lua`'s `ox_inventory` read can genuinely yield
  (an uncached vehicle trunk triggers a real lazy DB load), and a
  supervisor could revoke the searching officer's certification during
  that window. Without a second check, an already-decertified officer's
  in-flight search would still return its full result to them and could
  still trigger the contraband-alert broadcast to bystanders.
  `HasK9Access` is now re-checked immediately after that awaited read
  returns, before any result or broadcast is produced — rejected with a
  distinct `access_revoked` reason (logged to `k9_search_log` as
  `search_failed`, since a real inventory-read attempt did occur) rather
  than letting the in-flight search complete.
- **Corrected an invalid ped model in the K9 roster.** `Config.Peds`'
  Husky entry shipped as `a_c_huskie`, which is not a real GTA native ped
  model name — nobody could actually create or play a husky-modeled
  character under that spelling at all, so the roster entry was silently,
  completely non-functional rather than merely mis-labeled. The real
  native model is `a_c_husky`; `Config.Peds` now uses it.
- **Fixed the Phase 4 HUD's stamina reading being inverted.**
  `GetPlayerSprintStaminaRemaining` actually tracks sprint *exertion* —
  rising toward 100 as the player tires — despite its name, confirmed
  against multiple independent, widely-used community HUD resources.
  `client/hud.lua` now displays `100 - GetPlayerSprintStaminaRemaining(...)`
  so the stamina bar reads full-when-fresh and draining-when-tired, the
  way a stamina bar should.
- **Corrected an inaccurate native call shape in the water-crossing
  check.** `client/tracking.lua`'s water-detection helper called
  `GetWaterHeightNoWaves` with a trailing `0.0` argument as if the height
  were an input parameter; it's actually an extra Lua return value, and
  Lua silently discards an unused extra argument — so this was never a
  behavior bug, only a call shape that misdescribed the native. The call
  and its surrounding comment now match the real, community-confirmed
  `local found, waterHeight = GetWaterHeightNoWaves(x, y, z)` convention.

### Known Limitations

- **`Config.Features.ScentTracking` still ships `false` by default**, but
  is no longer a hard "can never functionally succeed" exception — its
  server-side source resolution (the `ox_inventory` `swapItems` hook
  described in the Added entry above) is now implemented. What remains is
  a verification gap, not a missing implementation: the hook's exact
  name/payload shape was confirmed this pass by direct source-reading
  (`ox_inventory`'s own `modules/inventory/server.lua`, corroborated two
  independent ways) rather than by an independent test against a live
  install, and the recommended one-time dev-time mitigation — logging
  `json.encode(payload)` once against your actual target-server
  `ox_inventory` version to confirm field names before relying on this in
  production — has **not** been performed as part of this pass. Do a
  one-time verification of that hook against your own `ox_inventory`
  install before enabling this flag in production; see
  `phase2_notes/scent_source_resolution.md` §2/§6 for the full confidence
  breakdown.
- Door interaction's nudge-open sub-feature is now implemented, but purely
  as a cosmetic push impulse/sound on the K9's own ped — it never reads or
  changes the door's actual lock state, and by design has no way to detect
  whether a given door is genuinely passable versus locked. It is not, and
  is not intended to be, an actual door-opening mechanic; treat it as
  flavor, not a functional unlock. `Config.DoorInteraction.nudgeRequiresUnlocked`
  remains hard-pinned to `true` via the resource-start assertion described
  above, since there is still no real lock-state check anywhere in this
  feature for that field to meaningfully gate.
- The husky ped-model fix above was scoped to `Config.Peds` itself.
  `client/movement.lua`'s Sit and Scratch-to-alert scenario lookup tables
  (`K9_SIT_SCENARIO_BY_MODEL_HASH` / `K9_DOOR_SCRATCH_SCENARIO_BY_MODEL_HASH`)
  still key on the old `a_c_huskie` spelling as of this writing, so a real
  husky K9 currently falls back to the default Shepherd sit/bark animation
  rather than the intended Retriever substitution until those two lookup
  tables are updated to the corrected model name.
- Phase 4's new vitality HUD (`Config.Features.HealthStaminaHUD`, still
  `false` by default) reads hunger/thirst from
  `QBX.PlayerData.metadata.hunger`/`.thirst` on the assumption those field
  names and a 0-100 scale match a live `qbx_core` install — this has
  **not** been independently verified against a real install this
  session (medium confidence per the design note it implements). Confirm
  against your own server's actual metadata schema before enabling this
  flag. Health and stamina are sourced from real client natives instead
  and are not affected by this caveat.
- Phase 3 (combat/action features) still has **no implementation** — only
  design scoping (`PHASE3_SPEC.md`). That document's Revision 3 reverses
  its own earlier NPC-only default: player-vs-player K9 combat is now a
  settled, in-scope design decision for whenever Phase 3 implementation
  eventually starts. This is a design-document change only — no `.lua`
  file was touched to produce it, and no combat code of any kind exists
  yet. The same revision leaves one item explicitly unresolved and
  flagged blocking: whether a non-cooperating player's client can be
  *prevented* (not merely detected) from ignoring a relayed combat
  restriction — no `Config.Combat` flag should be enabled and no
  player-target combat implementation should start until that question is
  answered.
- This batch has not yet had the same end-to-end release-readiness
  sign-off Phase 1 received; treat everything above as pending final
  packaging, not a shipped release.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-23

Initial Phase 1 release: a player-controlled K9 unit built on top of a
player's own persistent dog-model character, rather than a spawnable/
AI-controlled pet. This resource is purely an access-control and
interaction layer — it never spawns, despawns, or possesses a ped on
anyone's behalf.

### Added

- **Certification system** — qualifying officers (per `Config.Departments`
  grade thresholds) can certify or revoke a K9 handler via `/k9certify`,
  `/k9decertify`, and matching ox_target options on nearby players. A
  handler must be playing an eligible dog model (`Config.Peds`) to be
  certified, and certification is tracked per `(citizenid, job)` pair in
  a new `k9_certifications` table so history survives job changes and
  reconnects.
- **Offline revocation** — `/k9decertifyoffline [citizenid] [job]` lets a
  qualifying officer pull a certification from a handler who isn't
  currently connected.
- **Automatic revocation on leaving the department** — a handler's active
  certification is automatically revoked the moment they change jobs away
  from a K9-eligible department.
- **Consensual two-player leash system** — an officer can send a leash
  request to a nearby K9 handler (radial menu or ox_target); the handler
  must accept before anything attaches. Once attached, the K9's movement
  is elastically pulled back toward the officer as they separate, with an
  automatic hard-cap detach as a safety valve. Either party can detach at
  any time with zero consent required, so no one can be trapped leashed
  against their will.
- **"K9 Unit" radial menu** — a single radial entry point for Bark, Sit,
  Attach/Detach Leash, and Enter/Exit Vehicle, gated behind both the
  relevant `Config.Features` flag and a live server-side access check on
  every selection.
- **K9 vehicle load/release** — certified handlers can load their K9
  character into/out of configured K9 vehicle models (`Config.K9Vehicles`)
  via the radial menu or ox_target.
- **Bark relay** — a basic, cooldown-limited bark sound that a certified
  handler can trigger for nearby players to hear.
- **First/third-person K9 camera toggle** — a rebindable keybind (default
  `L`) that switches the game's built-in follow camera to first-person
  while playing a K9 character, using the native camera system's own
  per-model eye-height handling.
- SQL migration (`sql/install.sql`) for the `k9_certifications` table, and
  a `metadata.k9certified` read-only mirror written to the player's
  `qbx_core` metadata for client-side HUD display only (never used for
  server-side authorization).

### Fixed

These four issues were found and fixed during Phase 1's review passes,
after code review had already produced one "all clear" sign-off — they
are called out individually here because that earlier sign-off did not
catch them, and each was independently confirmed fixed before Phase 1 was
actually cleared to ship.

- **Fixed the K9 Unit radial menu being completely non-functional.**
  Every Phase 1 radial action (Bark, Sit, Attach/Detach Leash, Enter/Exit
  Vehicle) hard-errored the instant it was selected, because the menu's
  registration mixed a submenu-navigation item in with the action items
  in a single flat `lib.addRadialItem()` call with no matching
  `lib.registerRadial()` — ox_lib tried to navigate into a submenu that
  was never registered and threw before any action ever ran. The
  submenu is now registered properly via `lib.registerRadial`, with a
  single opener item on the root wheel linking into it.
  (`client/radial.lua`)
- **Fixed a leash-request spoofing and notification-spam gap.**
  Declining a leash request used to notify whatever server ID the client
  sent, without first checking that a real, matching pending request
  actually existed — letting a modified client spam arbitrary online
  players with fake "request declined" notifications, and silently
  swallow a genuine request meant for someone else in the process. The
  pending request is now validated before anything is sent or consumed.
  (`server/main.lua`, `respondLeashAttach`)
- **Added a missing rate limit on certification grant/revoke actions.**
  Granting, revoking, and offline-revoking a K9 certification — the most
  sensitive actions this resource exposes — had no per-officer rate
  limit, leaving room for a rapid grant/revoke toggle loop against a
  target. All three paths now share a per-granter cooldown.
  (`server/certifications.lua`)
- **Fixed the K9 first-person camera getting stuck on a resource
  restart.** Toggling the first-person K9 camera left the game's
  built-in follow-cam in first-person mode with nothing to reset it if
  the resource restarted mid-session. An `onResourceStop` handler now
  resets the camera to third-person, but only if this resource actually
  changed it, so an unrelated player camera preference is never
  clobbered. (`client/movement.lua`)
